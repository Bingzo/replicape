Todo list going from rev. 0 to rev. 1
 + Add an aluminum electrolyt cap to limit LC spikes: http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/EEE-1HA101UP/PCE3917CT-ND/766293
 + Add one more 0.1uF ceramic cap near VMM2.
 + Switch places for the caps near Y, Z, Ext1, Ext2 
 - Consider increasing the width of the VMM tracks. 
 + Add more thermal vias for the SMDs
 - Consider adding a coil for noise suppression near the DAC. 
 + Switch the M24C16 EEPROM out with M24C256 to allow for proper addressing, 
 + Switch the 3-switch dip with a two-switch or jumpers. 
 - Consider adding 5.6K pullups on i2c-lines
 + connect p9_1 to ground.
 - Change the X2 connector, it does not fit ATX power supplies
 + Move the MOSFETs further apart, consider a way to keep them separated.. 
 + Consider placing the PWM circuit on the I2C2-bus with the EEPROM. 
 + Place the all heaters on dedicated PWM outputs form BB. 
 + Levelshift the PWM signals to the heaters with comparator/op-amp (296-9544-1-ND)
 + Move Fault_x to GPIO1_7 = P8_4, the current pin is a PWM..
 + Add a decoupeling cap to the levelshifter
 - Add lables to the SMD outputs (A1, A2, B1, B2)
 + Switch channels for ADC on Ext1 and Ext2?
 + Switched +5V and SYS_5V.
